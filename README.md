- 👋 Hi, I’m Lisa
- 👀 I’m interested in forest health and interacting disturbances--especially pertaining to diseases--at individual to landscape scales
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more sophisticated hierachical Bayesian models to understand ecological dynamics over space and time, and I want to learn more about remote sensing to have an impact on a larger spatial scale
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that relates to forest diseases across landscapes and Bayesian hierarchical models
- 📫 How to reach me: lrosenthal@ucdavis.edu
